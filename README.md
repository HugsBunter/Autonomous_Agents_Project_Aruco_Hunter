# Autonomous_Agents_Project_Aruco_Hunter
This project is about a 4-wheel vehicle robot with a camera sensor, which will recognize a specific Aruco id (in this case id 5) in an area and has to chase it. The robot adjusts its trajectory in real-time to follow the target, which can be either stationary or moving. ROS, Gazebo, Python, and OpenCV are integrated for the needs of the project.
